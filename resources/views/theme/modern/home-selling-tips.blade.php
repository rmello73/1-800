                                            	There are many things to consider when selling your property. The first thing that any property owner should do is to put together a comprehensive plan and set some individual goals on what they are looking to accomplish with the sale. Understand that different times of the year are considered prime selling season. Each distinct time of year comes with its own selling strategies. For obvious reasons most people want to sell their properties for the most money as quickly as possible. You need to figure out how to give your home a competitive edge in any kind of market and put together a plan on how to make it happen. Below we have compiled a list of tips from industry professionals on the most effective ways that you can accomplish your goals and have a smooth real estate transaction.

                                            	This is the most important fact to consider when selling a property.  You have to be realistic with yourself and price it properly.  You can't think about what "you deserve" but rather what your property is worth in the marketplace.  We have provided links to appraisers (link to the appraiser page) and local real estate professionals(link to the real estate page)  in your area who will be able to give you an unbiased value of your property. Don't make the mistake of pricing your property too high as it can have a negative impact on your home if it doesn't sell in a reasonable time frame, as buyers will ask themselves "what is wrong with it"?  You also have to remember that the bank has to give the buyer a loan and will do their own appraisal on the house and buyers very rarely will pay above the appraised value for a property.

                                            <p>
                                            	Before you sell your property you should consider all of the costs associated with selling your home.  If you decide to have a real estate professional sell your home you need to factor their commission into your bottom line.  You also need to factor in closing costs, taxes, how much you are going to spend to get your property ready to sell and what it may cost to make any additional repairs requested by the buying party.  Putting a realistic cost list together in advance will help when it comes to closing time.

                                            	While a complete remodel may not be a great investment you should be prepared to give your home a facelift.  Cosmetic improvements, such as changing light fixtures, patching holes, and mending fences can give your home a new feel an ensure your home will show its best.  Home inspections are the number one place where sales fall apart.  By addressing problems beforehand, you won't have to renegotiate the sale price or even worse have the buyer back out of the deal.

                                            	Most buyers form their first impressions within seconds of driving up to any property.  Be sure to be detailed and one of the most important steps is creating curb appeal.  Make sure that your lawn is tidy and that your bushes are trimmed.  You don't need to be extravagant or even hire a professional, but a few bags of mulch and some new flowers can go a long way with creating that attractive first impression of the home.

                                            	You may need to rent out a storage unit if needed to get rid of excess clutter.  The more you can de-clutter, bathrooms, counters, desks, bedrooms, closets, shelves, drawers and basements the better off you will be.  People want to envision themselves living in your house and the more space you can show them the easier it will be for them to picture them living there.
