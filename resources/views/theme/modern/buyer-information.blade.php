                                            	The first critical step to buying any property is figuring out how much you can afford to spend. You should talk with mortgage professionals and put together a realistic budget, which needs to include the property taxes, insurance, and what type of down payment you are going to need to purchase the property. You should also plan on how much you are going to have to come out of pocket with for closing costs. Lastly, consult with your mortgage lender on the various types of loan programs that you qualify for and know the differences.

                                            	There is a difference between a pre-qualification and a pre-approval letter and most sellers want to know that you already have your financing in place before showing you anything. A prequalification letter is based upon what you told your mortgage lender that you make and what your debts are. A pre-approval is a more in-depth look at your actual debt to income ratio, which also involves pulling your credit as well as actual bank statements and paystubs. With new technology, it's easier than ever before to request both pre-qualification and a pre-approval letter.

                                            	Just because your lender has given you an amount that you can spend on a home doesn't mean you should max that amount they will lend you. Have a financial plan in place and know what you can really afford. Then you need to figure out a list of items that you need as opposed to what you want in a property. Location, size, home type, school district, and if the home needs to be move in ready or a fixer upper should be worked out at this stage.

                                            While it is highly advised that you work with a buyer's agent it is not a requirement to buy property. A buyer’s agent works directly for you and can help you with negotiations, advice and local knowledge. Oftentimes the seller will pay a portion or all of the buyer’s agent commission, so it often won’t cost you much if anything to hire a buyer’s agent. If you are negotiating directly with the seller, you may be able to get a lower price without an agent however because they won’t have to pay an additional commission. If you want to research local real estate agents, please refer to our agent page where you can see videos and read reviews to help you with your decision.

                                            	Of course you want to get the best deal that you can but there are many factors to consider before making an offer. First off you should know how long a property has been on the market, and how that home compares to others in the area that are similarly priced. You should also know what is going on in the area because in an extremely hot market you may be in a competitive bidding situation.

It should discuss your financing terms and the date that you are going to close on the property.

Lastly the offer should detail exactly what items or appliances you wish to stay with the property and when you are going to do your required home inspection.

As a buyer you need to make sure that you only offer what you can afford and it is imperative that you try your best to keep your emotions in check and keep your cool at all times. Once you have come to an agreement on the initial offer you will have a home inspection done and if you find items that you would like fixed you will have to negotiate once again. If you are open and reasonable in your requests, you should be able to come to a middle ground and keep the sale on track.

                                            	A home inspection is not a test where the inspector is going to give the home a grade of pass or fail. The home inspection provides a big-picture analysis of the state of the property in the form of a report which will give you tips on what items to monitor, and if there are any deficiencies with the property. The inspection is a critical part of any purchase and your offer should be contingent on having a professional inspection done. Don't get freaked out if a problem arises during the home inspection as you can usually solve the problem with a simple adjustment.

Just remember that this is going to take about an hour and if you have small children you probably want leave them at home so you can understand everything that you are about to sign. Good luck!
