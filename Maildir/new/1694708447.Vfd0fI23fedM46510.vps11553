There’s nothing to be embarrassed about.

There is so much new technology and so much to learn…

And there’s an incredible amount of noise online!

Up until now, technically challenged people have had a rough time of it online.

I say up until now, because a brand new technology has just been born.

It’s called auto tags and what it can do will blow you away.

Imagine having a funnel with dozens of buttons, automations, emails and more.

The stress of learning how to put it all together, make sure it’s all connected, editing all the buttons, emails, etc with your own links.

The thought of it is daunting to even a seasoned veteran in the online space like me!

Now imagine, there was a way to have tags in all of those buttons, links, signatures etc.

And all you have to do is enter your name and affiliate links ONCE in one area.

And they’re pulled automagically across every part of your funnel.

No editing required!

Sounds kind of like magic right?

And it does work like magic, and it’s the system my mentor’s been working on for over a year.

Now it’s okay to be a bit technically challenged :)

Plus we have a live weekly call every week to make sure you are supported every step of the way.
