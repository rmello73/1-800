Hi,

We'd like to introduce to you our explainer video service, which we feel can benefit your site hardscaperi.com.

You can view more of our work here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWz-ELfJVEI
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y46aNG-Y3rM
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJCFX1AjHKk

All of our videos are in a similar animated format as the above examples, and we have voice over artists with US/UK/Australian accents.
We can also produce voice overs in languages other than English.

They can show a solution to a problem or simply promote one of your products or services. They are concise, can be uploaded to video sites such as YouTube, and can be embedded into your website or featured on landing pages.

Our prices are as follows depending on video length:
Up to 1 minute = $239
1-2 minutes = $339
2-3 minutes = $439

*All prices above are in USD and include a full script, voice-over and video.

If this is something you would like to discuss further, don't hesitate to reply.

Kind Regards,
Georgina
