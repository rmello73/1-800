Hello, 
 
We provide funding through our venture capital company to both start-up and existing companies either looking for funding for expansion or to accelerate growth in their company. 
We have a structured joint venture investment plan in which we are interested in an annual return on investment not more than 10% ROI. We are also currently structuring a convertible debt and loan financing of 3% interest repayable annually with no early repayment penalties. 
 
We would like to review your business plan or executive summary to understand a much better idea of your business and what you are looking to do, this will assist in determining the best possible investment structure we can pursue and discuss more extensively. 
 
 
I hope to hear back from you soon. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Tigran Ayrapetyan 
Investment Director
